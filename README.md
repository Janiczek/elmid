# elmid

## TODO

- [ ] command-line options instead of hardcoded values
- [ ] preserve colors
- [ ] perhaps group by file?
- [ ] ellipsis-clamp the path *from the left* so that the filename is always shown
- [ ] try using https://github.com/turboMaCk/unix-recursive
- [ ] debounce
- [ ] after successful Elm compiler run, run elm-review too and display its errors similarly
- [ ] show the line number in the collapsed view
