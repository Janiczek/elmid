# elmid

## TODO

- [ ] allow scrolling
- [ ] ellipsis-clamp the path *from the left* so that the filename is always shown
- [ ] try using https://github.com/turboMaCk/unix-recursive
- [ ] debounce
- [ ] after successful Elm compiler run, run `elm-review` too and display its errors similarly
- [ ] show the line number in the collapsed view
  - [ ] open editor by clicking at the line number: https://tracy.nette.org/en/open-files-in-ide
- [ ] check for `Debug.log` and warn user about them (should still be "All good" even if they're there)
